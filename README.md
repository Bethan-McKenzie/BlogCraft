![Image of the Blogcraft homepage](https://github.com/Bethan-McKenzie/BlogCraft/blob/main/media/Homepage%20of%20Blogcraft.png)

Blogcraft is a site which aims to bring together the Minecraft community! They can share their builds, any bugs found, Minecraft content creators they like and so much more. The idea stemmed from my love of the game and the fact that there's not really a place dedicated to just Minecraft like this.

## Purpose

This website has been built using the Django framework for functionality with both frontend and backend.

Blogcraft allows the user to register, create posts as well as have a profile which can have the information (such as username and email address) changed and saved.
Currently there are three bugs in the site that I am unable to fix, due to time restraints caused by uncontrollable circumstances, and thus do not allow the user to delete their own posts, show the images that a user uploads when creating a post or allow users engage with the community through comments on posts (more information [here]() in the bugs section).

The link to the live site can be found [here](https://bethanmckenzie-blogcraft-b4a04edf4612.herokuapp.com)

## Features

## Homepage

A fully responsive homepage featuring posts that users have made inside cards that adapt their size based on multiple factors such as, the amount of text needing to be displayed, the size of the image for the post and the size of the screen the user is viewing on.

Featuring a navbar that changes options depending on if the user is logged in or not throughout the site and what areas they can access depending on that status.

The navbar is also responsive throughout ensuring users easy navigation throughout the site no matter what device they're accessing from changing to a dropdown menu for both tablet and mobile devices.

## Login

Users can eaily navigate to the login page where they are met with a prompt for them to sign in or if they have yet to register a link to sign up

The interface allows for users to click the 'remember me' checkbox to have the site remember their login details and quickly get into their account with no hassle!

Although unstyled the sign up page works perfectly for functionality.


## My Profile

When loggedin users can access their profile that for now only contains their username, email and when they signed up however future features are planned!

The page also contains a button to redirect the user to the edit profile page where they can edit their username and or email address and save those changes.

## Creating a post

Creating a post is extremely simple for the users, all they have to do is be logged in, navigate to the correctly marked page via navbar, fill in the relevant information and hit post!

## Post Detail

When the user clicks on the post they wish to see they're able to read what the user has posted from the title down to the last period. The user is able to see how many comments the post has at the top under the description text and were they to scroll down they can join the conversation with other members in the comments section of that particular post.

## Comments

Each post detail page has a comments section at the bottom where users will be able to engage with the community. There is a current bug where it's not fully functional right now, more about this [here]().
